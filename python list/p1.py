#List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

# Create a list
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
print(len(thislist))


list1 = ["abc", 34, True]
print(list1)
print(type(list1))

# Another way is to create a list that is the list() constructor
list2 = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets
